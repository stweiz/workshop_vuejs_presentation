- HTML DOM
    - structured and sorted tree
    - API to objects in tree, with which browser renders page and elements can be adjusted
- On big pages hard to manage and inefficient, if one element should be changed (XML paths)
- Virtual DOM
    - Abstraction of HTML DOM
    - Frameworks like Vue.js or React first manipulates its Virtual DOM with modified objects
    - These details are used to construct the change in the DOM, so both matches again and have no diff
