The HTML DOM is a structured and sorted tree. It's like an API to the objects in the tree with which the browser renders the web page and you can adjust elements.
On big pages, this is hard to manage and inefficient, if you want to change an element through the API.
The Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the DOM. Frameworks like Vue.js or React first manipulates its Virtual DOM with modified objects.
Then these details are used to construct the changes in the DOM to match the DOM and the virtual DOM.
